Description: Uses least squares optimisation to estimate the parameters of the best-fitting JohnsonSU distribution for a given dataset, with the possibility of the distributions corresponding to the limiting cases of the JohnsonSU distribution. The code for the Golden Section Search used in the optimisation has been adapted from E. Cai. This package has been created as an extension of my Master's thesis. E. Cai (2013, "Scripts and Functions: Using R to Implement the Golden Section Search Method for Numerical Optimization", <https://chemicalstatistician.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/using-r-to-implement-the-golden-bisection-method/>).
